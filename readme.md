## Minecraft Vanity Armor Datapack

<em>Created by FancyPotatOS</em>


Adds the ability to turn your armorsets into whatever armor pieces you want


### How To Use

Rename the target vanity armor piece to **_vanity_** in the anvil.
Throw the vanity piece and the target armor piece into a water cauldron.

When you hear bubbling, then the armor piece has been successfully overwritten

### Failsafe

There is no feature to undo a vanity change, however there is a function you can run in case you wish to split the pieces.

Run the command `/execute as @n[type=item] run function vanityarmor:split` to split apart the nearest item to you.
